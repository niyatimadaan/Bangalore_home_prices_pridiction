# Bangalore_home_prices_pridiction
a model to predict the Bangalore home prices

This data science project is a real estate price prediction model.
The model is built using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
During model building the data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. are used.

Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
